# Book Recommendation System

## Installation
We recommend using a virtual environment to keep your dependencies organized. And if you are using a virtual environment, you can install the dependencies in the virtual environment.
This way you do not have to overload your system with dependencies.

You can learn more about virtual environments in the [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) documentation.

Then you can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the code
To run the code in a notebook:

```python
from main import main
main()
```
Or you can run the code in the terminal:
```bash
python3 main.py or python main.py
```
